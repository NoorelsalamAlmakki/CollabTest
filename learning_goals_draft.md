# 🎯 Learning Goals – CSDP Data Science Team

This project is not just about deliverables—it’s about growing as data scientists and collaborators. We define individual and collective learning goals to maximize the benefit of this experience.

## 📌 Individual Learning Goals
Each team member is encouraged to:
- Identify 1–2 **technical skills** to focus on (e.g., feature engineering, model selection, data visualization).
- Identify 1 **collaborative or soft skill** (e.g., presenting results, giving feedback, managing time).

## 🎓 Team Learning Goals
As a team, we aim to:
- Practice **collaborative coding** using Git and pull requests.
- Build **reproducible workflows** and document our processes clearly.
- Improve **data storytelling and communication** of results.
- Embrace **feedback and peer learning** to continuously improve.

## 📝 Reflection
- At the end of each milestone or sprint, we conduct a short **learning reflection session**.
- Members share what they learned, what challenged them, and how they grew.

> We view constraints not as limitations, but as frameworks for creativity.  
> Through clear communication and shared learning goals, we grow stronger—as individuals and as a team.
