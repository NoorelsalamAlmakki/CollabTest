# 🌟 Group Norms – CSDP Data Science Team

As part of the MIT Emerging Talent Program, our group is committed to building a culture of collaboration, mutual respect, accountability, and transparency throughout all phases of our data science project. These norms guide how we work, communicate, make decisions, resolve conflicts, and support each other.

---

## 🤝 Trust & Accountability

- We commit to **doing what we say we will do** and completing our tasks by the agreed deadlines.
- If an unexpected situation arises, we **communicate early and clearly** so the team can adjust.
- Repeated failure to deliver or attend meetings without communication will be **addressed openly and respectfully**.
- Trust is foundational; **we repair it through dialogue, not silence**.
- We encourage **accountability check-ins** during weekly meetings to review task progress.

## 📢 Communication Protocols

- **Primary tools**:
  - **GitHub** for issues, pull requests, and task-specific discussions.
  - **Slack** for general team communication and informal updates.
  - **Zoom** for scheduled meetings or urgent discussions.
- **Best practices**:
  - Keep **GitHub issues up to date** with progress and blockers.
  - Tag relevant team members when action is needed.
  - Use **threads** on Slack to keep conversations organized.
  - Schedule ad hoc meetings with clear objectives and time limits.

## 📅 Meetings and Collaboration

- Meetings are held **weekly or biweekly** and scheduled based on team availability.
- Each meeting will have a **circulated agenda at least 24 hours in advance**.
- **Meeting minutes** are recorded and shared for transparency.
- Everyone is encouraged to speak, and discussions are facilitated to ensure equal participation.
- We **start and end meetings on time** out of respect for everyone's schedule.

## 🧠 Idea Sharing, Discussion & Decision-Making

- All ideas are welcome during brainstorming sessions—**there are no bad ideas**.
- Discussions aim to explore all angles, while debates are used to make informed decisions.
- Decision-making will follow one of these approaches:
  - **Consensus**, if possible.
  - **Majority vote**, if needed.
  - **Expert judgment**, when highly technical or urgent.
- Disagreements will be handled respectfully with **data-driven arguments**, not personal critiques.

## 🧪 Coding & Workflow Norms

- Follow GitHub flow:
  - Use **feature branches**: `feature/<task-name>`.
  - Submit **Pull Requests (PRs)** for review before merging.
  - Use our PR template and link related issues.
- At least **one team member must review and approve** each PR.
- Write **clear commit messages** and keep commits focused and small.
- All new features must include:
  - Documentation updates (if applicable)
  - Tests or validation (when possible)
  - Comments for clarity on complex code

## 📋 Feedback & Review Culture

- Feedback should:
  - Be **constructive and actionable**
  - Focus on the **work, not the person**
  - Highlight strengths as well as areas for improvement
- We **welcome suggestions** during reviews, and everyone is encouraged to ask questions.
- Code reviews are learning opportunities, not critiques.

## ❤️ Respect & Inclusion

- Every team member’s voice matters—**we create space for quieter members** to contribute.
- We do not tolerate discriminatory language or behavior.
- We assume **good intent** and strive to clarify misunderstandings kindly.
- We support each other's growth, ask for help when needed, and offer help when possible.

## 🔄 Adaptability & Reflection

  - Adjust team practices accordingly
- Norms can evolve—**we revisit and revise them together** as needed.
