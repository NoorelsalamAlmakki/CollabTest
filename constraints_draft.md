# 🚧 Project Constraints – CSDP Data Science Team

Some boundaries around our project. Constraints may arise from external sources, internal conditions beyond our control, or voluntary limits we impose to keep the project aligned and efficient.

---

## 🌍 External Constraints

These are imposed by entities or factors outside our team.

- **Program Deadlines**: Must align with CSDP/MIT Emerging Talent timelines.
- **Platform Policies**: Use only approved services (e.g., GitHub, Google Colab).
- **Data Licensing**: Adhere to terms of use for any third-party datasets.
- **Resource Availability**: Limited access to high-performance computing or paid APIs.
- **Mentorship Access**: Availability of mentors is constrained by their schedules.

## 🧷 Internal Constraints: Involuntary

These originate within the team but are not easily changeable.

- **Time Availability**: Team members may have academic or work commitments.
- **Skill Distribution**: Some areas (e.g., deep learning or advanced stats) may have limited expertise.
- **Tool Familiarity**: Varying levels of comfort with tools like Git, Python, or Jupyter.
- **Team Size**: Limited number of contributors for parallel tasking.

## ✋ Internal Constraints: Voluntary

These are self-imposed to foster a focused, ethical, and collaborative environment.

- **Data Ethics**: We will not use data containing personal identifiers unless fully anonymized.
- **Open Communication**: All updates and blockers must be shared regularly.
- **Task Ownership**: No one should take on multiple critical tasks at once.
- **Scope Management**: We will not expand the project scope without full team consent.
- **Documentation First**: No code or feature is considered “done” until documented.

> We define and honor these constraints to promote quality, responsibility, and alignment with our mission.
